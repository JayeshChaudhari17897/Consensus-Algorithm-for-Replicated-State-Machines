Consensus algorithm for replicated state machines.


UPDATE - This project is now running on system level, will soon update the running model on distributed systems. 

In first phase we are focusing on implementing a system level network and a GUI to visualize transactions [ Only needed for human satisfaction, not at all needed to build any application on hashgraph], in later phase we'll try to build this on TCP/IP level to take it to real world scenario.

Make sure you have read all the whitepapers on this link https://www.swirlds.com/whitepapers/ and know the proper implementation strategy.
